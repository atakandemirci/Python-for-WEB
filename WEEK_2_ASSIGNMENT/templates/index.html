                <h2>Hello Friends</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Atakan Demirci.
                    I’m an equity analyst.
                    Not sure how familiar you are with the finance industry but that basically means my job is
                    to analyze publicly traded stocks and publish reports about them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am starting an MS in Finance at Fordham in the fall and
                    right now I am taking coding classes at Baruch. I am planning to take the CFA examinations starting
                    in the summer.
                    I’ve also started an economics and finance blog because I wanted to explain financial topics in an
                    easy way
                    and help people with their financial literacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After graduation, my short-term goal is to stay in New York and work at an investment bank
                    like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, or Morgan Stanley. That way I can improve my skills and my experience
                    with
                    emerging markets. And in the long-term I hope to become a portfolio manager and keep growing my
                    clients’ assets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of professional experience, I worked on Wall Street, and at the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
                    I have analyzed a wide range of companies. I have built a strong track record averaging 25% return.
                    I helped investors generate new investment ideas and research stocks they already own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my experience in the finance industry, I’ve seen how easy it can be to get comfortable and stop
                    innovating.
                    So I made a resolution to always keep improving myself, and to seek analyst positions that could
                    expand my knowledge
                    of global finance.

                <h2>Things I like</h2>
                <p>
                    I love playing soccer! Especially on the streets. I enjoy baking and cooking with family for Sunday
                    breakfasts.
                    I lose track of time when I read anything exciting. There is also one thing I dislike, which is
                    hatred.
                    If you have so much of it please stay away from me and good luck with your rehab.

                <h2>Places I've been</h2>

                <p>
                    I cannot say I'm a big traveler. However for the sake of this personal page let me tell you some of
                    them.
                    Just to see some old friends I've visited Boston and Philedelphia in US. I've also been to some
                    Aegean cities
                    of Turkey like Bodrum, Izmir, Antalya. I also had to do a 6 months long military service on Syria
                    border in a city
                    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antakya">Antakya</a> which has great cuisine and
                    archeology museums.
